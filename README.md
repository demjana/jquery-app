### Simon is a game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison.
#### Gameplay
- The game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device.
- A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one buttons in a random order, <br /> after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons.
- As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
- If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.
- Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
