## 🟢🔴 Simon Game 🟡🔵
### Simon is a game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison.
- The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
- If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.
- Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.
